# An Efficient Asynchronous Method for Integrating Evolutionary and Gradient-based Policy Search

This repository is the official implementation of [An Efficient Asynchronous Method for Integrating Evolutionary and Gradient-based Policy Search](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/731309c4bb223491a9f67eac5214fb2e-Paper.pdf). 

## Coming Soon
The code will be available within one or two days!

Reason for late:  
We reimplemented all source code from scratch because the original code is hard to follow. 
(ex. lots of experimental features that are not used anymore)  
We tried to just clean it but finally decided to reimplement it.  
Now, the code is clean and easy to understand. (in my opinion)  
We finished the implementation and currently testing all environments and algorithms. (It is going well)  
All tests will be finished in one or two days and will be uploaded if there is no bug!
